# All-Ages Across-Wales Marathon!

Welcome to my first student project. A fictitious charity site supporting those with cardiovascular disease, via a publically sponsered anual marathon. <br> <br>
The subject of the site exists merely to fill in the spaces and demonstrate the code's intent. It does not exist to promote any real companies, nor was this project based or 
created upon any other project. It is completely independent, using images from Unsplash and icons from IconScout. <br> <br>

The duration of the project was aproximately 30-days, having suffered some delays due to the end of the year. However, it was sucessfully finished on the 31st of December, 2020.
The intent of site is and always has been: <br>
* Improve my skills in CSS, HTML & Bootstrap; <br>
* Challenge myself to improve and try new manners of coding; <br>
* Provide and create cleaner code, avoiding repetitions and errors in sintaxe; <br>
* Summarize CSS sheets and utilize both classes and ID's to their highest potential; <br>
* Use comments and organize each of the sheets in a way that most programmer can understand; <br>
* Create and complete a project of multiple sheets, sections and layers. <br> <br>

In case, you would like to read up on the creation process, you will find a file inside this repository containing photos and text registration of the site's creation. <br> <br>
If you would like to reach out and ask any questions, feel free to contact me via my LinkedIn account and I'll try my best to answer you as soon as possible. <br> <br>

Final Considerations: <br>
* Cleaner and more efficent code; <br>
* Experience in trouble-shooting and finding solutions; <br>
* Stronger comprehension of how to use all three involved techs. <br>
